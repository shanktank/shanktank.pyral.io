Configuration

	a) Navigate to directory 'php'
	b) Open 'example-config.php' for editing
	c) Set the credential/configuration variables
		Note: these are the credentials for the Clocker database, which should be
		owned by a generic user account rather than any specific administrator,
		and are not to be confused for LDAP credentials or the credentials of any
		individual student, employee, or staff member
	d) Rename 'example-config.php' to 'config.php'

	The creation and operation of individual tables (pay periods) is handled
	automagically and should not be screwed with by the administrator
